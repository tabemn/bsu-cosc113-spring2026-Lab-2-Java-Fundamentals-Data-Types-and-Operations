Part 1: Numeric Operations


Integer and Double Variables:
Declare two int variables and assign them different values.
Perform and print the results of the following arithmetic operations on these variables: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/), and modulus (%).
Label each output clearly (e.g., "The sum is: 15").
Next, declare two double variables and repeat the same set of arithmetic operations.
Observe and note the differences in the results, especially the output of the division operation.


Data Type Limits:
Declare a large long variable and a small float variable.
Experiment by assigning values that exceed their maximum or minimum capacities. For instance, try to assign 2147483648 to an int variable.
Pay close attention to what happens when a data type's limits are exceeded.


Part 2: Character and String Operations


Character Variables:
Declare a char variable and initialize it with a letter.
Print the ASCII value of the character to the console. (Hint: Java represents characters numerically, so you can easily cast a char to an int to see its value.)


String Variables:
Declare a String variable and initialize it with a complete sentence.
Using built-in String methods, perform and print the results of the following operations:
Print the length of the string using the length() method.
Print the character at a specific index using the charAt() method.
Print a substring of the string using the substring() method.
Print the entire string in uppercase and lowercase using the toUpperCase() and toLowerCase() methods.
